      question: "When does the digital apocalypse begin?",
      answer: "The chaos unleashes on October 5th, 2024, at 9:00 AM and continues for exactly 36 hours until October 6th, 6:00 PM. Time to save the world through code!"
    },
    {
      question: "Where will this epic battle take place?",
      answer: "At the fortress of innovation - Amity University, Lucknow. The exact location will be sent to registered warriors. It's a tech-enabled campus perfect for our digital warfare."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I bring to survive the apocalypse?",
      answer: "Your laptop (obviously), chargers, a brain full of algorithms, your student ID, comfortable clothes, and an insatiable hunger for victory. We'll provide food, drinks, and the battlefield setup."
    },
    {
      question: "Who can join this legendary quest?",
      answer: "Any current student with a valid student ID! Whether you're a coding ninja, design wizard, or business strategist - if you're in college/university, you're eligible to fight digital chaos."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I participate solo or do I need a squad?",
      answer: "Both! You can be a lone wolf or assemble a team of up to 4 members. Teams often have better chances, but solo heroes have won battles before. Choose your path wisely."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have a team yet?",
      answer: "Fear not! We have a team formation session during the event. You can also join our Discord server before the event to find fellow warriors. Great minds think alike!"
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be a coding god to participate?",
      answer: "Absolutely not! While coding skills help, we welcome all skill levels. Some challenges need design, business strategy, or just creative thinking. Every hero has their unique power."
    },
    {
      question: "What about food during this 36-hour marathon?",
      answer: "We've got your back! Meals, snacks, unlimited coffee, and energy drinks will be provided. We know you can't code on an empty stomach. Nutrition for the mind and body!"
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a participation fee?",
      answer: "It's completely FREE! This is our gift to the coding community. Just bring your passion, skills, and determination to change the world through technology."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I need to leave during the event?",
      answer: "Life happens! You can leave and return, but remember - continuous presence gives you the best chance of victory. If you must leave, inform the organizers so we don't send a search party."
    },
    {
      question: "How will projects be judged?",
      answer: "A council of industry experts will evaluate based on innovation, technical implementation, design, impact potential, and presentation. It's not just about code - it's about solving real problems!"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I work on an existing project?",
      answer: "Nope! All projects must be built from scratch during the 36 hours. Pre-existing code, frameworks, and libraries are allowed, but the core solution must be fresh. We're watching! üëÄ"
